            My IT trip started in 2017, when I joined Beetroot Academy courses of 'Front End'.
            After finishing courses I continue to learn and didn't give up trying to
            find a job.
            <br>
            <br>
            I made close to 16 test tasks before found a stable job. My first position was a HTML Coder.
            At first everything was good, but after some period I understood that I want to study in direction
            witch closer to development (make pages more dynamic via js) and somewhat need's to change.
            <br>
            <br>
            I went to new 'React.js' courses, finished it and obtained new knowledge for creating SPA.
            Little bit later I received an interesting opportunity to join US startup on Angular. First three months
            I worked as trainee, but after became a junior FE Dev. And here is my real IT career has begun ðŸ’¥
